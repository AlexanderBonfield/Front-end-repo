Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of 
the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you 
may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        
        output = [] 


        
        i = 0
        j = 0
        

        for i, num1 in enumerate(nums):
            for j, num2 in enumerate(nums[i+1:], i + 1):
                pair_sum = (num1 + num2)
                if pair_sum == target:
                    output.append(i)
                    output.append(j)
                    print(output)
                           
            i += 1
        return output


Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' 
and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
 


s = "()[]{}"
par = list(s)
print(par)
n = len(par)

store = []


for i in range(n-1):
